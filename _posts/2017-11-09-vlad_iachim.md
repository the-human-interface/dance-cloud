bio: Romanian artist based in Bucharest. I am a flexible and creative human being, in a constant endeavour to discover myself and expend my experience of life. I started my training in art at The National School and High School of Choreographic Art in Bucharest many years ago, as a young child, by studying classical dance and contemporary dance. My next step in my carier was to continue my studies at The National Academy for Theatre & Film that i graduated in 2014. I specialized in theatre-dance, film, choreography & stage acting in my years of training at this university. You can say i have a wide range of experience in stage work for theatre productions and dance-theatre productions. :-) In the last 15 years of work i basically extended my experience in the field of performing arts in an special and unique way. My activity in the domain of art was and is still nourished by the cultural experiments of many projects in dance, film, music, theatre, mime, television & most importantly, personal development. I extract my roots from the simple and profound miracle of the human being. Dancing, performing, the lyrical expression, the scenic language in its many forms, are for me an essential form of communication, in the lack of which people would be too poor, too empty, in danger of being too exposed to life threats and limited in their range of expression. And because not always each of us is dancing, performing or working to know thyself, i make my research in art be joy, offering and knowledge, for people and audiences, to take value from and share. I believe that in the course of our existence we need these forms of communication, in many moments, more then the simple communication through words. I invite you into my work by sharing with you the following link. Enjoy!
